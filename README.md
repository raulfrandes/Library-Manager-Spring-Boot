Developed a Java Spring Boot application utilizing Hibernate to interact with an H2 in-memory database. Implemented two RESTful API endpoints: GET /books to retrieve all books and POST /books to add new entries, requiring name, author, and publisher details. Introduced a separate entity for Publishers to practice many-to-many relationships. This project provided hands-on experience with Spring Boot Framework, HTTP Requests, H2 in-memory database, REST API development, Spring Data JPA, and Lombok. Future plans include implementing the frontend using Angular, integrating Spring Boot Test for endpoint testing, and adding more complex functionalities.
